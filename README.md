# final-project-cooking-app

Welcome to What's cooking app. This is my final project for my coding bootcamp!

This app is an online cookbook builder with a good amount of social interactivity added into it.
Here you can add recipes you find by going in the random recipe generator or by putting ingredients in the fridge and seeing what it gives back!
If you like any recipes you find you are then invited to click on the image and will be taken to that recipes page. From there you can add it to your personal cookbook to increase your collection of great recipes!

You can aswell share your recipe findings to the newsFeed where you will see other users posting about their discoveries and questions about cooking technics.

If you have any questions or any features you liked to see being added please feel free to message me by email at:
